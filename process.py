Now that the model has been trained, load it and process the data !

"""
Hpmpf. Maybe later; for now just add a toggle process_full_data AND EXPLAIN ABUNDANTLY ITS ROLE IN THE README

Say that you should run some tries, find a model you like, and THEN :
    - flip the load_saved_model switch to True (the model is automatically saved after training). not mandatory, if you don't you'll simply re-train the model with the current parameters.
        TODO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND SAY SO IN README : I believe if load_saved_model is true, we should skip the diagnosis steps like the Q_score
    - flip the process_full_date to True
